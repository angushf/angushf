### Hi there 👋
I'm a dynamic individual who transitioned from software sales to the world of software engineering! 👨‍💻

Currently, I'm immersed in my 4th year of Computer Science studies at the University of British Columbia. 📚

As a licensed pilot, I find my joy in the skies, though time to fly is a rare luxury these days. 🛩

My journey has been diverse and enriching: from earning a Bachelor of Commerce at the University of Victoria, to experiencing life in Shanghai, to navigating the skies as a pilot, and climbing the corporate ladder in software sales. Now, I've circled back to academia, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I thrive on learning and embracing new challenges! 💪

## What I'm Up To Now
+ Focused and enthusiastic, I'm learning new things everyday as a Full Strack Software Developer Intern at Checker Software in Vancouver, BC!
